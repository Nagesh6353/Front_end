                <p class="sub-title">A short digital adventure about curiosity, mystery, and unexpected discoveries.</p>
                <div class="blog-content">
                    <p class="blog-p">It started like any normal day. I opened my laptop, expecting the usual routine —
                        emails, assignments, and a few tabs of music. But then something strange happened. A tiny icon
                        appeared at the corner of the screen, glowing softly like a heartbeat.</p>

                    <p class="blog-font">Curiosity won. I clicked it.</p>

                    <p class="blog-p">Suddenly, the screen flickered and transformed into a dim hallway made of neon
                        lights and moving code. It wasn’t a glitch — it was a doorway. A doorway inside my laptop.</p>

                    <p class="blog-p">I walked forward, step by step, hearing the hum of digital winds and seeing lines
                        of code float like fireflies. Every door in that hallway led to a new world — one filled with
                        memories, one with unfinished dreams, and one with hidden possibilities.</p>

                    <p class="blog-p">By the time I returned to my room, everything felt different. The laptop looked
                        the same, but I knew I had unlocked something bigger — the idea that technology is not just a
                        tool, but a gateway to endless imagination.</p>

                    <p class="blog-p">As I reached toward the glowing door, the keyboard beneath my fingers rippled like
                        water. My room faded, replaced by a swirling tunnel of floating icons, broken code fragments,
                        and half-loaded memories. Every step felt like walking through a dream stitched together by old
                        browser histories. The door pulsed brighter, as if it knew I was coming. Curious—and slightly
                        terrified—I pushed it open.</p>

                    <p class="blog-p">Inside was a tiny room made of circuits and blue light. Tiny creatures—like pixels
                        with wings—fluttered around, carrying bits of data from one glowing shelf to another. One of
                        them flew up to me, scanned my face, and projected a hologram. “Welcome, User. You have accessed
                        the Kernel Chamber,” the hologram announced. My laptop had a secret world running underneath the
                        system… a world I was never meant to see.</p>

                    <p class="blog-p">Suddenly, a deep hum echoed through the chamber. The pixel creatures froze. A
                        massive shadow formed, rising from the floor like a corrupted file. “Intruder detected,” a
                        robotic voice boomed. The creature stepped forward—its body made of scrambled folders and
                        glitched images. My heart pounded. I didn’t know whether to run back through the door… or stay
                        and discover why my laptop had chosen today to reveal this hidden world.</p>

                    <p class="blog-p">Before I could move, the glitched creature raised an arm made of distorted code
                        and pointed at me. “System breach: unauthorized human detected.” The pixel creatures scattered,
                        hiding behind data blocks. Just as the monster stepped closer, a sudden spark shot across the
                        chamber. A tiny pixel creature—one that looked braver than the rest—flew in front of me and
                        projected a bright shield of light. “Run!” it chirped. But instead of running, something inside
                        me whispered, You didn’t come here by accident.</p>

                    <p class="blog-p">I held my hand toward the creature, unsure of what I was doing. The moment my hand
                        entered the glowing air, the entire chamber responded—panels on the walls lit up, files
                        reorganized themselves, and a strange symbol appeared beneath my feet. The corrupted monster
                        stopped moving. “System recognized,” it said in a calmer voice. The pixel creature lowered its
                        shield and looked at me with wide, glowing eyes. “You’re… the Architect.”
                        The title didn’t make sense. Me? The Architect of a digital world I didn’t even know existed?
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p">The chamber began to pixelate and fade. The monster bowed its head. The pixel
                        creatures gathered around me in glowing rings. “Your session has ended,” a voice whispered.
                        Suddenly—blink—I was back in my room, staring at my laptop screen. Everything looked normal
                        again. The hidden door was gone.
                        But then I noticed something chilling:
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-p">But then I noticed it.</p>
                    <p class="blog-p">A new folder on my desktop.</p>
                    <p class="blog-p">Named “Architect Files.”</p>
                    <p class="blog-p">When I moved the cursor over it, a whisper came from my speakers—quiet, yet unmistakable:</p>
                    <p class="blog-p">“Welcome back.”</p>
